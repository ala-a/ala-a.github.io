                                    A common assumption in game theory is that players concentrate on one game at a time. However, in everyday
                                    life, we play many games and make many decisions at the same time, and, thus, we have to decide how best to
                                    divide our limited attention across these settings. In this paper we ask how players solve this attention-allocation
                                    problem and how their decision affects the way players behave in any given game when that game is viewed
                                    in isolation. We find that the attention of players is attracted to particular features of the games they play: the
                                    maximum payoff in the game, the minimum payoff, the degree of inequality in the game’s payoff, whether the
                                    game has zero payoffs, the complexity of the game, and the type of game being played. Moreover, how much
                                    attention a subject gives to a particular game depends on the other game that he or she is simultaneously attending
                                    to.

                                        We experimentally examine the efficacy of a novel pre-play institution introduced by 
                                        Calcagno et al. (2014) in a well-known coordination game—the minimum-effort game—in 
                                        which coordination failures are a robust and persistent phenomenon. This new 
                                        institution allows agents to communicate while incrementally committing to their words, 
                                        leading to a sharp theoretical prediction: the efficient outcome is uniquely selected 
                                        in the extended coordination game. Commitment-enhanced communication significantly 
                                        increases subjects’ payoffs, and achieves efficiency levels considerably higher than 
                                        non-binding communication. We document that commitment alters communication, and that 
                                        subjects behave in a forward-thinking and myopically suboptimal manner at the 
                                        beginning of their interaction and then best respond as the deadline looms.

                                                    The paper introduces communication as a strategic choice in a regime change coordination 
                                                    game with incomplete information. Communication makes agents more aggressive and they 
                                                    take on the regime more often than they would without communicating.
                                                    Moreover, the agents attack the regime even more than they would if they acted based on
                                                    their combined information. Richer the massage space more coordinated the attacks are
                                                    with less unsuccessful attempts. The effect of communication on welfare is two-fold: (i) it
                                                    reduces one sided attempts on the regime, reducing wasted cost; (2) it increases the rate
                                                    of coordinated attacks. The experimental results show that communication does reduce
                                                    misscoordination, however, the subjects are not strategic with their messages and they
                                                    miss out on the opportunity to increase their welfare by being more aggressive as predicted by the theory. This result highlights how the effects of communication are different
                                                    in the environments with incomplete information, in contrast with the overwhelming experimental evidence that shows that communication is beneficial in coordination games
                                                    with complete information.

                                                        We investigate history dependent stopping behavior and identify factors that motivate 
                                                        people in non-monetary environments. In the context of chess games, we find that the 
                                                        history of wins/losses is an indicator of further participation. In particular, we 
                                                        find that there are two types of people: those who get discouraged by a loss and stop playing; 
                                                        and others, who get encouraged by a loss and keep playing until a win. We find that an 
                                                        individual's type is time-invariant over years. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice 
                                                        model where enjoyment from the next game is directly affected by the outcome of the 
                                                        previous game. We structurally estimate this time non-separable preference model and 
                                                        conduct counterfactuals to meet several objectives. In an environment where practice 
                                                        improves overall outcomes, type individualized incentives can improve welfare. We find that, 
                                                        in the context of chess games, adjusted incentives can increase the length of play.

                                                            When time is scarce, we need to plan how to allocate our attention across decision tasks.To study this problem, we present subjects with pairs of games between which they have toallocate a fixed amount of decision time (attention).  We then let subjects play each pair ofgames without time constraint and use eye-tracking to measure how much time subjects spendplaying each game in a pair.  We find that subjects’ planned and actual attention allocationdiffer.  We identify the determinants of this difference and show that this discrepancy can bepayoff relevant in games where choice is time-dependent.

                                        We study the interaction of two well-known behavioral norms – truth-telling and fairness. Experimental
                                        findings collectively suggest how in isolation, each of these phenomena emerge in spite of what rational
                                        models of homo economicus might predict. But how do they complement each other? To address this
                                        question, we construct a simple modification of the ultimatum game in which the responder has private
                                        valuations over the surplus to be shared and can communicate these to the proposer via cheap-talk
                                        messages. We take this game to the lab. When provided with minimal yet explicit incentives to lie, we
                                        find that play involves not only greater incidence of lying, but also convergence to self-interested play.
                                        That is, the outcomes of the ultimatum sub-game largely revert to its unique sub-game perfect
                                        equilibrium. Our results speak to a linkage effect between social norms.
