                                    A common assumption in game theory is that players concentrate on one game at a time. However, in everyday
                                    life, we play many games and make many decisions at the same time, and, thus, we have to decide how best to
                                    divide our limited attention across these settings. In this paper we ask how players solve this attention-allocation
                                    problem and how their decision affects the way players behave in any given game when that game is viewed
                                    in isolation. We find that the attention of players is attracted to particular features of the games they play: the
                                    maximum payoff in the game, the minimum payoff, the degree of inequality in the game’s payoff, whether the
                                    game has zero payoffs, the complexity of the game, and the type of game being played. Moreover, how much
                                    attention a subject gives to a particular game depends on the other game that he or she is simultaneously attending
                                    to.

                                            People often need to plan how to allocate their attention across different tasks. In this
                                                    paper, we run two experiments to study a stylized version of this attention allocation problem
                                                    between strategic tasks. More specifically, we present subjects with pairs of 2x2 games, and,
                                                    for each pair, we give them 10 seconds to decide how they would split a fixed time budget
                                                    between the two games. Then subjects play both games without time constraints, and we use
                                                    eye-tracking to estimate the fraction of time they spend on each game. We find that subjects’
                                                    planned and actual attention allocation differ and identify the determinants of this mismatch.
                                                    Further, we argue misallocations can be relevant in games where a player’s strategy choice is
                                                    sensitive to the time taken to reach a decision.

                                                We augment the standard rational inattention model by allowing the decision maker to alter the
                                                distribution of payoffs. The model captures real-life circumstances in which decision makers choose
                                                their incentives to pay attention, for instance, through the choice of insurance (full-coverage contracts
                                                reduce the incentives to pay attention compared to partial coverage). This new framework, specifically
                                                the ability to observe the decision maker’s choice of payoff redistribution, allows us to elicit the
                                                decision maker’s targeted attention level. This is a novel method of eliciting the object of interest—
                                                attention—typically obtained through performance (i.e., repetitions) in the literature. Furthermore, by
                                                manipulating the cost of payoff redistribution, the framework allows us to examine rational inattention
                                                models without making parametric assumptions on the cost of attention function. With a laboratory
                                                experiment, we validate novel comparative static predictions of our model. The subjects respond to
                                                the link between payoff redistribution decisions and attention in accordance to the theory.

                                        We experimentally examine the efficacy of a novel pre-play institution introduced by 
                                        Calcagno et al. (2014) in a well-known coordination game—the minimum-effort game—in 
                                        which coordination failures are a robust and persistent phenomenon. This new 
                                        institution allows agents to communicate while incrementally committing to their words, 
                                        leading to a sharp theoretical prediction: the efficient outcome is uniquely selected 
                                        in the extended coordination game. Commitment-enhanced communication significantly 
                                        increases subjects’ payoffs, and achieves efficiency levels considerably higher than 
                                        non-binding communication. We document that commitment alters communication, and that 
                                        subjects behave in a forward-thinking and myopically suboptimal manner at the 
                                        beginning of their interaction and then best respond as the deadline looms.

                                                        In this paper, we investigate market design for online gaming platforms. A significant fraction of such platforms' revenue is generated by advertisements, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Thus, it is necessary to understand which factors influence how much time users spend on the platform. We focus on one such factor - the outcome of the previous game. Using data from an online chess platform, we find strong evidence of history-dependent stopping behavior. We identify two primary types of players: those who are more likely to stop playing after a loss and those who are more likely to stop playing after a win. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice model in which the utility from playing another game is directly affected by the previous game's outcome. We structurally estimate this time non-separable preference model and then conduct counterfactual analyses to evaluate alternative market designs. In the context of online chess games, a matching algorithm that incorporates stopping behavior can substantially alter the length of play.

                                                                Team decision-making is often conducted under looming deadlines, where time constraints affect team communication and, consequently, team decisions. This study examines teams' ability to communicate and reach an agreement under time pressure in a coordination game and consequent performance. We find that teams are significantly better at coordination compared to individuals in the absence of time constraints. Teams under time pressure still target more efficient equilibria than individuals if they reach an agreement. However, disagreements are frequent, and teams no longer exhibit less miscoordination than individuals. Consequently, time pressure near entirely wipes out the gains from teams making decisions instead of individuals. Finally, we investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the detrimental effect of time pressure on performance by analyzing communication content and applying the experience-weighted attraction learning model.
